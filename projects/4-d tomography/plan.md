## Key features
1. Eathquake's parameters are asumed to be latent
2. Division into geographic blocks and velocity blocks: small geographic blocks for high-quality ray tracing modeling and smaller velocity blocks for more stable inverse problem solving.

## How to validate
1. **Discrepancy**
2. Visual comparison with CMH-S
3. Time-arrival
